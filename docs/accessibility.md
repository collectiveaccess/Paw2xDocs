# Accessibility

Web accessibility is essential to ensure that websites and web applications can be used by people with diverse abilities and disabilities. The main parts of web accessibility considered for Pawtucket2x:

### Semantic HTML
- Use proper HTML elements to structure content (headings, paragraphs, lists) so that screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret and convey information accurately.

### Alternative Text (Alt Text)
- Provide descriptive alternative text for images so that users with visual impairments can understand the content conveyed by the images.

### Keyboard Accessibility
- Ensure that all functionality can be accessed and operated through a keyboard alone. Ensure that users can easily navigate through the content using keyboard tabbing, and that focus indicators are visible and clear.

### Color Contrast
- Use sufficient color contrast between text and background to ensure readability for users with low vision or color blindness.

### Responsive Design
- Design websites to be responsive, ensuring that content is accessible and usable across a variety of devices and screen sizes.

### Forms and Input
- Design accessible forms, providing clear instructions and ensuring that form fields are programmatically associated with their labels.

### Aria Roles and Attributes
- Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content and user interface components.
