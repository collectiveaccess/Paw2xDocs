# About

The Contribute module enables construction of forms for user-submitted content. Each form corresponds to a record type in CollectiveAccess. Some or all fields defined for a record type may be displayed, as well as form elements for media upload and creation of relationships. Contribute form submissions are tagged on the back-end with the submission form used, user information and status. A back-end moderation system enables approval and rejection of submitted content. 

The Contribute form is meant to support crowd-sourcing of data, or limited data entry is contexts where providing back-end access to all potential submitters is not practical or possible.
