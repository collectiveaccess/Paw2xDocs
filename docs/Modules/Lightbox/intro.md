# About

The Lightbox module allows for uses to add records of different type (ex. ca_objects) to a group called a Lightbox. This feature provides a convenient way to collect, organize, and manage related records within a single workspace. Users can create multiple lightboxes to categorize and store records based on specific needs or workflows. The Lightbox module is ideal for scenarios where users need to group related records for tasks such as curation, research, or collaborative projects.
